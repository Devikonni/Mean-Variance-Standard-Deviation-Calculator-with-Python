# 📊  Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator-with-Python
A Python project  is part of the [freeCodeCamp - Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) certification. It uses **NumPy** to compute statistical measures such as **mean**, **variance**, **standard deviation**, **min**, **max**, and **sum** on a 3x3 matrix.

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Created a function `calculate()` that:
  - Takes a list of 9 numbers
  - Converts it into a 3x3 matrix using NumPy
  - Computes statistical values:
    - Row-wise (axis=1)
    - Column-wise (axis=0)
    - Flattened
  - Returns the results in a dictionary

- Implemented input validation to ensure the list has exactly 9 elements
- Wrote unit tests to validate each calculation

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Gitpod (for development)
- Git & GitHub
